# EVM Specification

Design a microprocessor Voting Machine which has provision for 8 candidates. It should keep the count of total votes polled and the count of votes polled for each candidate. Before being put in use, it should check if all memory location allotted to candidates, and the total count are empty. If not, it should clear these as well as the display. To put it in use, it needs to be enabled by 8 polling agents and the Presiding officer. The enabling is to be done by entering passwords. If any one is incorrect it should not be enabled. After 10 hours (7 a.m. to 5 p.m.) it should stop taking input. There has to be a provision that the Presiding officer by pressing a [key1] can lock it in between & then can restart it by pressing [keys]. The Officer can lock and unlock the machine by using a password only. For retrieving the count of each candidate provision should be there.
